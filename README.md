# Self License
A minimal, simple self applicable and usable license standard, stack and set. Visit https://legal.ikdao.org/license

## Introduction:

As human artifacts have grown, evolved and still growing and evolving to myriads of capabilities and capacities; particularly in digital domain. There ever arise need for license(s) to address the issues that come with these creation like terms, conditions, rights, authorship, ownership, etc. And over time there made quite a mount of licenses which instead of help and keeping it to their simple purpose, turn the whole process more complicated and troubling for creators, engineers, artists, developers to find the right one in left of time for their project or work. We at ikdao were no different. Good to mention India and south asia with highest amount of creators and software engineers it would be of valuable meaning to have its own creative work license standard and stack. These licesnse are not limited to human use.

So we start working and figure out what license and licensing is, its intricacies and working on making a license standard, stack and set, called Self License, it's meant to be minimal and simple to use over any or all creative work including digital artifacts or assets.

## Meaning:

Self License are just to self and its determined conditions. It's called self as creators can self attest or attach these licenses in their projects or work. As existence/ reality itself a natural just and neutral of implicit, implicable ownership, authority and changeable, until explicitly made and maintained. Thats why Self, until some self do it, its non existing.

## Purpose:

To minimize and simplify licensing and making new license over and with easy to understand and usable semantic syntactic standard similar to semantic versioning that some artists, creators, engineers or developers aware of.

## Set of Rules:

The rule to use for Self License is naming and notational where conditional declaration of value at declared positions(a positional value syntax) with reverse priority order, respecting that determine/derive semantics/meaning of license i.e. terms and conditions.

### Declared positions

Position 0 - Condition(s); can be subconditional
Position 1 - Attribution(s); can be of an individual, group of individuals, organisation
Position 2 - Accountability; can allow relicensing and sublicensing.

Condition: 
a state, situation or factors affecting behaviour of something, here it is used to determine conditions of license. if first value of license is 0 then means no conditions applied i.e. equivalent to no pemission required or no restritions imposed, If first values is 1 then its on the stated set of terms and conditions

Attribution: 
A obligation to linkback or credit to this creator(s), if second value is 0 then no attribution or credit required, if second values is 1 then there must exist attriution and credit to creator.

Accoutability: 
A obligation to a set of linkbacks or credit to all creator(s)/contributor; order insensitive, by convention series follow last creator/contributor first/top seperated by '|' or newline, respectively

### Declared Values - 

0: false
1: true
x: undefined

### License Name and derived conditions

License name and notaion from declared values at declared positions suffixed with sl, short for, Self license.

#### Without suffixed

'x' means undecided
'0' means there exists no terms.
'1' means there exists set of terms.
'00' means there exists no terms, conditions; and no attribution
'01' means there exists no terms, conditions; and attribution
'10' means there exists set of terms, conditions; but no attribution
'11' means there exists set of terms, conditions; and attribution
'000' means there exists no terms, no attribution, no accoutability
'001' means there exists no terms, no attribution, accoutability
'010' means there exists no terms, and attribution, and no accountability
'011' means there exists no terms, and attribution, and accountability
'100' means there exists set of terms, and no attribution, and no accountability
'101' means there exists set of terms, and no attribution, and accountability
'110' means there exists set of terms, and attribution, and no acountability
'111' means there exists set of terms, and attribution, and acountability

#### with Suffixed
