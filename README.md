## Introduction:

As human artifacts have grown, evolved and still growing and evolving to myriads of capabilities and capacities; particularly in digital domain. There ever arise need for license(s) to address the issues that come with these creation like terms, conditions, rights, authorship, ownership, etc. And over time there made quite a mount of licenses which instead of help and keeping it to their simple purpose, turn the whole process more complicated and troubling for creators, engineers, artists, developers to find the right one in left of time for their project or work. We at ikdao were no different. Good to mention India and south asia with highest amount of creators and software engineers it would be of valuable meaning to have its own creative work license standard and stack. These licesnse are not limited to human use.

So we start working and figure out what license and licensing is, its intricacies and working on making a license standard, stack and set, called Self License, it's meant to be minimal and simple to use over any or all creative work including digital artifacts or assets.

## Meaning:

Self License are just to self and its determined conditions. It's called self as creators can self attest or attach these licenses in their projects or work. As existence/ reality itself a natural just and neutral of implicit, implicable ownership, authority and changeable, until explicitly made and maintained. Thats why Self, until some self do it, its non existing.

## Purpose:

To minimize and simplify licensing and making new license over and with a ease to understand and usable semantic syntactic standard similar to semantic versioning that some artists, creators, engineers or developers aware of.
